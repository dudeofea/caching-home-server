# Caching Home Server
A local HTML caching server (not TCP!) suited to low bandwith or limited internet availability users. The hope is to have full
caching ability of any website and being able to have neat features like running a proxy server (with a good internet connection)
to compress everything sent to the low bandwith computer and even omit as much as possible so that only what is required is sent.

Progress: ~30%
